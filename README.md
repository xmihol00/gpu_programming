# GPU programming
Optimizing code to run as fast as possible on a GPU. All credits goes to the **GPU programming** group at TU Graz, for providing the framework and all necessary files for compilation and testing. Code written by me is in the following files:
```
-- simple_iir/
    |
    |-- include/
    |    |
    |    |-- IirFilterEngine.cuh
    |    |
    |    |-- IirFilterEngine.h
    |
    |-- src/
    |    |
    |    |-- IirFilterEngine.cpp
    |    |
    |    |-- IirFilterEngine.cu
    |
    |-- challenge.md

-- full_iir/
    |
    |-- include/
    |    |
    |    |-- IirFilterEngine.cuh
    |    |
    |    |-- IirFilterEngine.h
    |
    |-- src/
    |    |
    |    |-- IirFilterEngine.cpp
    |    |
    |    |-- IirFilterEngine.cu
    |
    |-- challenge.md
```
